# Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)

This repository contains my codes for the Coursera's course of Bioinformatics. The programming exercises for this course were UNGRADED. So, I uploaded them here. If they were graded exercises, I wouldn't do such a thing because it would be unethical and against the Coursera's Code of Honor.
